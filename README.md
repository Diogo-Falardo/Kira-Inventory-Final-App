# Kira Inventory — Final App

The **Kira Inventory Final App** is an enhanced and restructured version of the prototype [Kira Inventory](https://github.com/Diogo-Falardo/Kira-Inventory) project.  
It was developed as a more complete and production-oriented solution for inventory and stock management, built with a full-stack architecture using, **React**, **Svelte**, **FastAPI**, and **MySQL**.

---

## Overview

This version aimed to evolve the initial project into a production-ready application — featuring an improved backend, refined frontend, and better overall integration between both layers.

The system allows efficient management of **products**, **users**, and **stock operations**, offering clear dashboards and streamlined workflows.

## 🚀 Project Status

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This project was designed with the goal of being released to the market.  
> However, it was not deployed publicly, as I decided to take additional time to improve my **frontend architecture**, **UX design**, and **code quality** before launching a robust, maintainable full-stack application.  

This repository represents the final experimental version used for testing and architectural refinement.
